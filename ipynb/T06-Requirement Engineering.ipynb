    "Goatilicious, a small company based in Suffolk, has been making luxury goat milk ice cream for nearly ten years. Its owner and *Managing Director* (*MD*), <u>Warren Randall</u>, runs the business from his farm where he and his staff rear the goats and make the ice cream which is sold to farm shops, delicatessens, restaurants and schools across the East of England.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The herd now comprises some 300 mainly Anglo-Nubian goats and is maintained by *Head Goatherd*, <u>Malcolm Illingworth</u>, and five other stock workers who also undertake the twice-daily milkings. Under the supervision of *Production Manager*, <u>Rachel Scott</u>, the team of ten food technicians manufacture the ice cream in over forty flavours (some as stock items and some made to order only) and package it in 5-litre napoli containers, for serve-over counters, and retail tubs of 1-litre and 0.5-litre as well as ‘spoon in lid’ convenience tubs of 125 ml. The ice cream is stored on-site in walk-in freezers at -29°C, and using the company’s own freezer vans, delivered to customers by the five drivers and *Logistics Manager*, <u>Rhys Hawksby</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Ellie Martin</u> (*Office Supervisor*) co-ordinates all of the company’s activities from the office onsite, where she and her two office staff process customer orders and invoices (and payments) and run the payroll as well as trying to keep on top of maintaining levels of consumables, such as feed and bedding for the goats and the various added ingredients required to make the ice cream. Beyond a couple of simple spreadsheets and the COTS payroll system there is no automation in the office and, following the recent expansion of the company and in the light of Warren’s plans for the next year which include opening more channels to market and increasing sales by another 15%, Ellie has been expressing concerns over her team’s ability to cope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Under some pressure from Ellie, Warren has agreed to look into the possibility of developing an integrated IT system to automate a lot of the office work and to assist with stock control (and possibly, herd management). Having discussed this with the Management Team (MD, Production Manager, Logistics Manager, Office Supervisor), Warren has made a start on identifying requirements for the system, but has quickly got out of his depth. He has decided to limit the system initially to handling customer orders and invoices and has now hired you as a Business Analyst to continue the work, known as the First Step project. The new system will need to take customer orders and produce invoices. It has occurred to Warren that it might drive up sales if customers could place orders online as well as by phone and this is now a top priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements Warren has identified so far are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All new customers need to be added to the system easily.\n",
    "2. The system must record customer orders (not payments yet) up to about 50 per day. These need to be retained for five years.\n",
    "3. Office staff can do 1. & 2. and so can customers themselves, via the website.\n",
    "4. The system should generate (but not send) invoices automatically as orders are received.\n",
    "5. Office staff (only) must be able to revise the details of an order and a new invoice should be generated as a result.\n",
    "6. Weekly reports of unpaid invoices will be needed by the MD.\n",
    "7. Office staff must be able to print invoices or email them to customers.\n",
    "8. The Production Manager would like to be able to view all customer orders so that she can plan production.\n",
    "9. It should be possible to vary the payment terms on the invoices\n",
    "10.It all needs to interface with the payroll system (MD’s requirement)"
